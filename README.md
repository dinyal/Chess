# Chess
A C++ object-oriented program that allows a user to run and play chess via the makefile.

Please see ChessMain.cpp for examples on how to input chess games into the program and run them. This is output to the terminal.

I implemented more complex OODP principles such as inheritance, virtual/pure virtual functions, copy constructors, copy assignment operators, and a robust class model to design the program in as clear and efficient way possible.

Remember to compile the code using 'make' before attempting to run ./chess.
